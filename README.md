# Trading advisor system

This is a small collection of tools for me to build an automated Binance trader bot with. It is a work in progress and will be updated.

## "License"

Please take note of the following, especially if you want to use this code for your own purposes:

1. This code is written by me, for my own needs, in the way I feel comfortable with, not as a public artifact that caters to everyone.
2. I have put this code into a public repository for the following purposes:
  - for fun;
  - for self-accountability;
  - to possibly receive some feedback from other people;
  - to share it easily with friends and acquaintances should I feel the need to;
  - so that people who are concerned with hiring me may see an example of my code. ðŸ™ƒ
4. I make no claims about any results that you may or may not get from using this code and thus will take no responsibility for any consequences to your finances or otherwise. Trading is a high-risk activity, I am by no means a professional, and the world is volatile and unpredictable.
5. I can be quite stupid and make stupid mistakes sometimes. Probably more often than you. Please double check any third-party code that you use for financial operations, not just mine.
